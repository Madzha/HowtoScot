      <h1>Food</h1>
      <br>
      <p> While other Europeans or Internationals like to belittle the British and Scottish cuisine, Scotland has to offer a lot in terms of food. Probably most well known for its speciality Haggis, Neeps and Tatties (read as Haggis, Turnip and Potatoes), Scotland also offers a range of different specialities. Many tourists like to book a whisky tour when in Scotland, but its craft beer does also not disappoint.
      Scotland shares (even if they do not like it all the time), a lot of similarities in terms of food with the rest of the United Kingdom. Whether you want to enjoy a full English/ Scottish breakfast, enjoy some afternoon tea with sandwiches beautifully presented to you on an etagere or eat a hand-crafted Sunday Roast, Scottish Food does not disappoint.
      Many of these ingredients you can buy in your local supermarket like Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, Scotmid or Waitrose. But discounters like Aldi or Lidl will stock many Scottish items too. Scottish cuisine does not just contain meat however, many Vegeterian or Vegan people can also enjoy a great variety of food. Homemade soups are a big thing in Scotland and can be enjoyed with different seasonal vegetables.
      But even if you do not just want to eat Scottish food while you are here, there are plenty of other foods to choose from. Scottish people love to go out for food and there is an abundance of restaurants everywhere you go. Whether you want to try Indian, Thai, Spanish, French or Mexican, there is a restaurant that will cater to your taste. Embracing this diversity in terms of food and drink,
      definitely enriches the Scottish food landscape and means that you will never get bored.

      <h1>Language</h1>
      <br>
      <p> While traditional Scots might be incredibly hard for some foreigners to read, it is not how the Scottish people talk. You will be absolutely fine with your British English that you learned at school. But knowing a few Scottish words is always useful and the Scottish people will love you for it. It just shows that you embrace their culture and language.
      Don't overdo it though, as the Scots themselves will think you are a little crazy then. Sublety is key, using a few Scottish words here and there is much nicer and probably also easier to remember. Take the lovely word "wee" for example. It is a great word to explain that something is small or little. It can easily be exchanged for when you want to say sth like "a little house"
      which then quickly becomes "the wee house". Doesn't it already sound much cuter and more friendly? Yes, I thought so. There are literally hundreds of words like that, just make your pick and have fun with it. But beware, maybe it is not a good idea to ask for the way to the cludgie (the old Scots term for toilet), this might end in more amusement than you wanted.
      If you are seriously interested in what old traditional Scots is like, have a look at Robert Burns poetry. Robert Burns is that famous, that there is a "Burns day" in his name on which most Scots eat their Haggis, Neeps and Tatties.

      <br>
      <p> Hi, my name is Sibylle and I currently a MSc Student in Computer Science. I am fairly new to coding and programming. I only started to look at code and learn the basics when I was 22 years old when I was looking
      for a more interesting elective than the ones that were on offer in the Business School and took an Introduction to Programming course. My undergraduate was in Economics and whilst I still like Economics, I love everything Tech! I am mostly self-taught and try to pick
      things up as I go along. I am especially interested in how technology can transform learning for young people and break up the more traditional approach of books and blackboards, which is why I interned as a Digital Intern in the Tech Group at Oxford University Press.
      When I don't code, you find me watching Sci-Fi films or reading dystopian literature. You can contact me on the following:</p>
