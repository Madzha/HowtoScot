      <h1>Scottish Culture</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
      While at first glance, Scotland might seem the same as all the other home nations, it has a distinctive feel to it because of it's unique culture. Unlike the popular misconception, Scotland has much more to offer other than bagpipes and kilts. One of the terms of the 18th century union with England was to allow Scotland to maintain it's Scots law system. The system remains to this day in the modern legal courts in Scotland making it different from the English way of law enforcement. Scotland also has its own banknotes for the British pound, complete with Scottish sceneries.
      Scotland is the birthplace of golf, which can be easily seen by the extensive amount of golf courses scattered not only through the countryside but also the cities. Several other sports, such as curling, shinty and water polo were first played in the land of Scots. Most popular sports nowadays include rugby, football, field hockey, fencing and rowing amongst others.
      Annual Highland Games are a series of events held in Summer all across Scotland which celebrate Scottish culture. The main focus of the games is the competitons in traditional dancing, drumming and piping and Scottish heavy athletics. These events are the root of the stereotypical view of Scotland - men in kilts, playing bagpipes.

      <h1>Outdoor</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
      Many tourists come to Scotland to enjoy the fantastic sceneries all across the Higlands and the Islands. Whatever your favourite outdoors activity is, Scotland is the place for it. Walking and especially hill walking is probably one of the best ways to experience the real untouched beauty of the Scottish countryside. Many tourguides available online will provide you with details of the best hill walk for your abilities and requirements. For a start, Isle of Skye is one of the most popular destinations for hill walkers. For the more athletic, cycling and running are two other options for exploring the outdoors even further. One of the most memorable moments you can experience in Scotland is on top of a hill in the remote countryside with no one but your travel companion around as far as the eye can see.

      <h1>Weather</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
      Another classic stereotype is about the horrible weather in Scotland. This is mostly true about the west coast of Scotland which receives the strongest winds and one the largest annual rainfalls in Europe due to the Gulf Stream from the Atlantic. Although it can be wet and windy, the temperatures are never extreme anywhere in Scotland, average low winter temperature is only 0°C and summer high - 15-17°C. The east coast is a pleasant place to be, especially if you're in Dundee which is Scotland's sunniest city, averaging 1523 hours of sunshine per year! Eastern Scotland receives about the same amount of rainfall as New York, Barcelona, Rome or even Rabat in Morocco. Keep in mind though that weather forecasters still haven't cracked the Scottish weather so expect short showers at any time of day even if it's supposed to be clear all day. Forget about umbrellas, those will break with the first gust of wind - waterproof jackets is the way to go. Also, walking with an umbrella will expose you as a tourist and we don't want that do we? ;)

      <h1>Food</h1>
      <br>
      <p> While other Europeans or Internationals like to belittle the British and Scottish cuisine, Scotland has to offer a lot in terms of food. Probably most well known for its speciality Haggis, Neeps and Tatties (read as Haggis, Turnip and Potatoes), Scotland also offers a range of different specialities. Many tourists like to book a whisky tour when in Scotland, but its craft beer does also not disappoint.
      Scotland shares (even if they do not like it all the time), a lot of similarities in terms of food with the rest of the United Kingdom. Whether you want to enjoy a full English/ Scottish breakfast, enjoy some afternoon tea with sandwiches beautifully presented to you on an etagere or eat a hand-crafted Sunday Roast, Scottish Food does not disappoint.
      Many of these ingredients you can buy in your local supermarket like Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, Scotmid or Waitrose. But discounters like Aldi or Lidl will stock many Scottish items too. Scottish cuisine does not just contain meat however, many Vegeterian or Vegan people can also enjoy a great variety of food. Homemade soups are a big thing in Scotland and can be enjoyed with different seasonal vegetables.
      But even if you do not just want to eat Scottish food while you are here, there are plenty of other foods to choose from. Scottish people love to go out for food and there is an abundance of restaurants everywhere you go. Whether you want to try Indian, Thai, Spanish, French or Mexican, there is a restaurant that will cater to your taste. Embracing this diversity in terms of food and drink,
      definitely enriches the Scottish food landscape and means that you will never get bored.

      <h1>Language</h1>
      <br>
      <p> While traditional Scots might be incredibly hard for some foreigners to read, it is not how the Scottish people talk. You will be absolutely fine with your British English that you learned at school. But knowing a few Scottish words is always useful and the Scottish people will love you for it. It just shows that you embrace their culture and language.
      Don't overdo it though, as the Scots themselves will think you are a little crazy then. Sublety is key, using a few Scottish words here and there is much nicer and probably also easier to remember. Take the lovely word "wee" for example. It is a great word to explain that something is small or little. It can easily be exchanged for when you want to say sth like "a little house"
      which then quickly becomes "the wee house". Doesn't it already sound much cuter and more friendly? Yes, I thought so. There are literally hundreds of words like that, just make your pick and have fun with it. But beware, maybe it is not a good idea to ask for the way to the cludgie (the old Scots term for toilet), this might end in more amusement than you wanted.
      If you are seriously interested in what old traditional Scots is like, have a look at Robert Burns poetry. Robert Burns is that famous, that there is a "Burns day" in his name on which most Scots eat their Haggis, Neeps and Tatties.

      <h1>About us</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Meet Madara and Sibylle - two young girls studying in Edinburgh and learning how to make pretty websites.

      <br>
      <p> Hi, my name is Madara and I'm a 2nd year BSc student in Biomedical Sciences. My only experience with coding and programming was an outside course in the basics of C programming last year which I enjoyed so much that I wanted to continue my journey in this field. I'm interested in the field of health informatics, gathering and analysing health data and it's usefulness for the wider population. I've been interested in all things tech ever since I can remember myself.
      In my free time, I'm usually out running or orienteering, latter being an important part of my life since early childhood. I also love to listen to music and read about history. </p>

      <br>
      <p> Hi, my name is Sibylle and I'm currently a MSc Student in Computer Science. I am fairly new to coding and programming. I only started to look at code and learn the basics when I was 22 years old when I was looking
      for a more interesting elective than the ones that were on offer in the Business School and took an Introduction to Programming course. My undergraduate was in Economics and whilst I still like Economics, I love everything Tech! I am mostly self-taught and try to pick
      things up as I go along. I am especially interested in how technology can transform learning for young people and break up the more traditional approach of books and blackboards, which is why I interned as a Digital Intern in the Tech Group at Oxford University Press.
      When I don't code, you find me watching Sci-Fi films or reading dystopian literature. You can contact me on the following:</p>
